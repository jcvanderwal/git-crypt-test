= Git-crypt test



https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt

== Setup

The initializer of the repository performs the following command:

**git-crypt init**

This initializes the repository with git crypt. Next the .gitattributes can be initialized to specify the files which are encrypted
(See example .gitattributes above)

The next commit with specified file extension will be encrypted.

To share the key with collaborators perform the following command:

**git-crypt export-key /path/to/key**

This creates a key which can be shared (securely) and makes it possible for collaborators to decrypt the specified files.

This is done by the following command:

**git-crypt unlock /path/to/key**


== Example


. Create a file `john-only.secret`
. Create a file `john-jeroen.secret`
. Create a file `shared-key.secret`
